# DIG-winter-gaming

I am being a bit extreme and setting up a github so we can collaboratively decide and define the games we are going to play!

## Games:
I want to set up the following games:

### Continuous:
- [ ] Open TTD
- [X] Vanilla Minecraft [minecraft.womeijer.com](minecraft.womeijer.com)
- [ ] Simple Modded Minecraft [minecraft.womeijer.com:1337](minecraft.womeijer.com:1337) (Get Minecraft 1.20.1, Install [Fabric](https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/installing-fabric), get [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric) )
- [ ] Modded Minecraft (super complex) [TBD: Simo]
- [ ] Satisfactory [TBD: Bashar]

### Special event:
 - [ ] Gartic Phone
 - [ ] Code names

## Events:
- December 6th: launch of DIG winter gaming session
- December 14?th: Gartic Phone
- December 15?th: Code names!
- December 22nd: launch of gaming week

## Help flesh this out!
I know using github is a bit over the top, but give me suggestions for games to play, events, timing, things you want to see, or help setting up severs here or on whatsapp!
