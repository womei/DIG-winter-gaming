# DIG-winter-gaming

I am being a bit extreme and setting up a github so we can collaboratively decide and define the games we are going to play!

## Games:
I want to set up the following games:

### Continuous:
- [ ] Open TTD
- [X] Vanilla Minecraft [minecraft.womeijer.com](minecraft.womeijer.com)
- [ ] Modded Minecraft (Create)
- [ ] Modded Minecraft (super complex)
- [ ] Â¿Factorio?

### Special event:
 - [ ] Gartic Phone
 - [ ] Code names

## Events:
- December 8th: launch of DIG winter gaming session
- December 14th: TBD special game
- December 15th: TBD special game
- December 22nd: launch of gaming week

## Help flesh this out!
I know using github is a bit over the top, but give me suggestions for games to play, events, timing, things you want to see, or help setting up severs here or on whatsapp!
